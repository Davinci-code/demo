Hunter, Heather E. \r\nSent: Thursday, March 17, 2016 9:34 AM\r\nTo: Bradley, Darcy; Billesberger, Cliff\r\nCc: Dhanaraj, Alma\r\nSubject: iPad Mobile App issue\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI have followed up with the issue that Janelle described in the attached e-mail.  They were having issues with people entering loads into a closed TDL through the iPad app.  Staging has now been refreshed with PROD data so I can test this on my phone.  When I first opened the app, I could not see any options to add loads to FC-TDL#20 as all of the licences have now been closed in the CWT (see the first set of screenshots).  This is as expected, once a licence has been closed in the web version of CWT, it should no longer appear on the mobile app.  \r\n\r\nI then went into the web CWT STAGING and changed the closing date of TDL-377526 FC-TDL#20 to be 2016-03-31.  When I re-logged into the mobile app, I could now see TDL-377526 FC-TDL#20 as an option for entering loads \u2013 this is expected.  I could also see TDL-373944 FC-TDL#20 as an option for entering loads \u2013 this is NOT expected.  As you can see in the second set of screenshots, the 373944 Licence is still closed and as such should not be available on the mobile app.  \r\n\r\nI am thinking that there is a problem with something in the background of the app that is linking the two water source management items together.  Do you have any suggestions as to why this is happening and how we can fix it?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification!\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nHeather \r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots \u2013 set 1:\r\n\r\nBelow is a screenshot of all Water Source Statuses for FC-TDL#20 as it currently is in PROD.  They have closed out the water source as the winter program is coming to an end, but it allows me to highlight the issue with the app really well.\r\n \r\n\r\nScreen Shots from the mobile app before I changed the expiry date of FC-TDL#20.  There are no options to enter a load into  FC-TDL#20\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots \u2013 set 2: \r\n\r\nI changed the closing date for FC-TDL#20 to 2016-03-31 (for Licence: TDL-377526)\r\n \r\nScreenshots from the CWT App \u2013 STAGING, after I changed the closing date.  The only option should be to add loads to FC-TDL#20 on License: TDL-377526, however as you can see, I am now also able to add loads to TDL-373944.  \r\n\r\n \r\n","calendar_duration":"","close_notes":"","sys_class_name":"sc_request","closed_by":"c346f4cd95a4de00f0592d4609cb7a7c","follow_up":"","sys_id":"4cd65a882b9f1a40f269dc60f8da1528","contact_type":"phone","urgency":"3","u_service_domain":"","company":"","reassignment_count":"1","u_priority_count":"1","activity_due":"","assigned_to":"c346f4cd95a4de00f0592d4609cb7a7c","comments":"","approval":"approved","sla_due":"","due_date":"","sys_mod_count":"2","sys_tags":"","u_reference_knowledge":"","escalation":"0","upon_approval":"proceed","correlation_id":"","location":""},{"parent":"e38d36f613ea724066e25d622244b07b","made_sla":"true","watch_list":"","upon_reject":"cancel","sys_updated_on":"2017-06-05 10:09:55","approval_history":"","skills":"","number":"TASK0718647","sys_updated_by":"ad","opened_by":"bbfebb85a97fcd007a598827d2c7cbae","user_input":"","sys_created_on":"2017-06-02 16:41:45","sys_domain":"global","state":"3","sys_created_by":"sayotte1","knowledge":"false","order":"13000","__status":"success","closed_at":"2017-06-05 10:09:56","cmdb_ci":"e798e1214f1c6e80d5d9ee6d0210c782","impact":"3","active":"false","u_comments_and_work_notes":"","business_service":"8970c26a4fc3ea008b3785c98310c7e6","u_opened_by_group":"293d4d757b2f800005c3cb304b4d4da0","priority":"3","time_worked":"","expected_start":"","opened_at":"2017-06-02 16:41:45","business_duration":"1970-01-01 06:18:15","group_list":"","work_end":"2017-06-05 10:09:55","approval_set":"","wf_activity":"","work_notes":"","short_description":"Termination - Remove Nithyakalyani Panju from all instances of Complete Well Summary","correlation_display":"","work_start":"","assignment_group":"147c5a1a18812400885f8c657d4fb0ad","u_caller":"65527fe92b92ae44f269dc60f8da15db","additional_assignee_list":"","description":"","calendar_duration":"","close_notes":"","sys_class_name":"sc_task","closed_by":"c346f4cd95a4de00f0592d4609cb7a7c","follow_up":"","sys_id":"4ce37a620f43be443436807be1050ed7","contact_type":"self service","urgency":"3","u_service_domain":"","company":"","reassignment_count":"0","u_priority_count":"0","activity_due":"","assigned_to":"c346f4cd95a4de00f0592d4609cb7a7c","comments":"","approval":"not requested","sla_due":"","due_date":"","sys_mod_count":"2","sys_tags":"","u_reference_knowledge":"","escalation":"0","upon_approval":"proceed","correlation_id":"","location":""},{"parent":"","made_sla":"true","watch_list":"","upon_reject":"cancel","sys_updated_on":"2017-05-10 06:00:37","approval_history":"","skills":"","number":"INC0516428","sys_updated_by":"system","opened_by":"fc533e5329002900f2692738ed3a38b9","user_input":"","sys_created_on":"2017-05-05 18:07:43","sys_domain":"global","state":"3","sys_created_by":"mujah","knowledge":"false","order":"","__status":"success","closed_at":"2017-05-10 06:00:37","cmdb_ci":"0baa2b6818da5804885f8c657d4fb0d8","impact":"2","active":"false","u_comments_and_work_notes":"","business_service":"8970c26a4fc3ea008b3785c98310c7e6","u_opened_by_group":"d625dccec0a8016700a222a0f7900d06","priority":"3","time_worked":"","expected_start":"","opened_at":"2017-05-05 17:45:11","business_duration":"1970-01-02 19:14:48","group_list":"","work_end":"","approval_set":"","wf_activity":"","work_notes":"","short_description":"Missing Training in traccess","correlation_display":"","work_start":"","assignment_group":"ea3c49757b2f800005c3cb304b4d4dc2","u_caller":"8b48de600f8672043436807be1050eee","additional_assignee_list":"","description":"Issue: Client called the SD reporting that he is missing training in traccess -  ICS cyber Security awareness training \r\n\r\nKB # :  KB0011488\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Document Client Initial Email HERE if applicable**\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n** Continue on to Work-notes **","calendar_duration":"1970-01-05 12:15:26","close_notes":"1.
